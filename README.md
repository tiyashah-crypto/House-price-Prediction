House Price Prediction Using Python and Machine Learning:

TABLE OF CONTENTS:

INTRODUCTION:

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of rooms, and age using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Ridge Regression. The model can help real estate agents, buyers, and sellers estimate the value of a property.


INSTALLATION:

Step 1:Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git

cd house-price-prediction

Step 2:Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

Step 3: Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

USAGE:

Step 1: Data Preprocessing: Run the script to preprocess the data:

python src/data_preprocessing.py

Step 2: Model Training: Train the model using:

python src/model_training.py

Step 3: Prediction: Predict house prices by running:

python src/prediction.py --input data/new_house.csv

MODEL EXPLANATION:

The project uses two main algorithms:

Linear Regression: A simple linear approach to model the relationship between features and the target (house price).

Ridge Regression: A regularized version of Linear Regression that adds a penalty to large coefficients, helping prevent overfitting.

DATASET:

The dataset used for this project contains features like:

Size of the house (in square feet)
Location
Number of rooms
Age of the house
Price (target variable)
The dataset is stored in the data/ directory.

RESULTS:

The model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. It showed a good performance in predicting house prices, with an MSE of X and an R-squared of Y on the test set.
